Title: Time series forecasting of European Energy Market

Abstract:
Due to climate change, the EU is shifting towards renewable energy. In 2022, the share of renewables in gross energy consumption in the EU has reached 23%, and it aims to reach 42.5% by 2030. In this dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the energy market, the ability to accurately forecast the evolution of the markets is a critical component for market participants. The project aims at developing a framework capable of accurately forecasting the trend of individual renewable energy components contributing to the overall balance of the EU power sector.

The framework processes time-series data for individual energy components. Chronologically sorted observations of regular intervals allow for the derivation of temporal dependencies, historical patterns, and the current trend in the market. These derivations help establish the linear dependence the past values impose on the current values of the variable. Furthermore, they aid the estimation of short-term fluctuations not captured by linear dependence. Our framework combines these predictive analyses to make forecasts using the well-established AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average method.

The majority of major renewable energy sources are intermittent or seasonal, hence, inconsistent. Our framework addresses these challenges by enabling market participants to estimate the non-renewable energy supply required to meet market gaps, while considering potential fluctuations in renewable energy production and cross-border market demand. By providing a systematic approach to balancing renewable and non-renewable energy sources, our framework contributes to the creation of a green and balanced energy market in the EU, ensuring sustainability and reliability for the future.
