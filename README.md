Title: Time series forecasting of European Energy Market

Abstract:
Due to climate change, the EU is transitioning towards renewable energy,
aiming to increase its share in gross energy consumption to 42.5% by 2030
from the current 23%. However, the intermittent and seasonal nature of
renewable energy sources presents challenges in predicting their production
capacity. In this dynamic and ever-evolving landscape of the energy market,
the ability to accurately forecast the evolution of renewable energy’s stake
in the market is a critical component in the decision making process of
policy makers, and market participants alike. This project aims to explore
and evaluate the performance of well-established forecasting methods in an-
ticipating the trends of individual renewable energy components, ultimately
contributing to the fostering of a balanced, sustainable, and reliable energy
market in the EU.

The primary focus of our framework is to assess auto-regressive forecast-
ing methods, which leverage chronological data intervals to capture temporal
dependencies from market history, thus ensuring accurate forecasting. How-
ever, instead of evaluating the model purely reliant on auto-regression, we
examine more intricate models which extend to incorporate moving-average,
exploit seasonality of time series data, or those utilising the correlation with
exogenous variables. Furthermore, To get a better understanding of not only
accuracy, but precision of the models, short-term forecasts are made itera-
tively to provide a bigger pool of model performance samples. All model’s
performance in forecasting the individual energy components are evaluated
by measuring and visualising the Root Mean Square Percentage Error be-
tween forecast result and the test data.
